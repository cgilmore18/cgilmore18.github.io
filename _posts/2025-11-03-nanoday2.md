Welcome to Nano 2.0: Week 1! I'll be updating this post throughout the week to keep you posted on my novel progress.

## November 3rd
It's Monday, November 3, 2025, aka Day 3 of NaNo 2.0 (aka my first day of writing). I was away this weekend enjoying Halloween, so I didn't have a chance to write. Today, I have to write at least 1,773 words. I've already got a 10,284 words toward my first draft, and I'm aiming to have at least 60,000. So, I still will be fulfilling this challenge by writing 50k words this month. As I write, I'm realizing that I'm more of a "pantser" than a "planner."

Pantsers are writers who start writing and find out how events unfold as they write. Planners, on the other hand, will map out the main events, outlining the novel before getting started on content. I feel like in the early phases it's been natural for me to assume both the pantser and planner roles. Switching between both is great for getting to know my characters. For each character that appears in my writing, I like to think like that character and write from their point of view, as if I'm writing as them in their diary. As I "pants" my characters, I put on the "planner" cap, writing notes in the margins outlining how later events will unfold, noting areas I'll want to return back to or reference in later chapters. I've found that some of my best ideas arise from this process.

What I'm looking for now is to get a sense of what behaviors and choices will align with my characters' personalities before making big plot decisions. Since I have a good idea of what events I want happening in my book and have written character sheets with information on personality and characteristics for the main characters, this is where my planner side comes in. For now, it feels right to wear the "plantser" title.

### I just met my daily goal!
Just wrapped up 1800 words. I went to a café this morning so I could hyperfocus. Iced chai tea is good fuel for me. Now, a brownie to reward myself! If you're reading this and want to do this challenge, this is your sign. :')
