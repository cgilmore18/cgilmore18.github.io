# The power of rhythm in writing

---

Not long after graduating college, I used to work at this charming little bookstore. Having just weathered COVID and a severe mental health crisis that struck my campus, I had looked specifically for bookstore jobs and was thrilled to have landed this one. One particularly slow day, I looked up from a stack of books I was logging into our _very antiquated_ inventory system to find a man clutching a briefcase, clad in a tan suit and fedora. Not long after greeting him, I found myself listening to him intently about a writing method he had invented. His method focused on creating a distinct, rhythmic pattern that would keep readers engaged. This memory came to me last week in a vivid flash. What I remember most was the fervor in his eyes that seemed to exclaim, “I’ve done it! I’ve cracked the code of writing!”  Frustrated that I had forgotten his name and misplaced his heavily annotated business card, I took to the internet to play a little game of _Guess Who_ with ChatGPT. I just had to identify this mystery man and method. His name was John G. Maguire, and upon finding his [website](https://www.readablewriting.com/), I was greeted with the same fedora-wearing man I had pictured in my head. And what's this special method called? _Readable Writing_. Who would have guessed that the secret to good writing is making sure it's readable? HA! But, wait! There's more...

## Writing that sings and forces you to listen

> “This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.” - Gary Provost

I stumbled across this quote while searching for John Maguire, and it arrested me. This is what writing is all about. Last year, I read this book called _Zen Guitar_---definitely read it if you haven't. This idea comes up that that good music should blend into the background. For example, let's say I was to perform a guitar piece for someone while they're occupied with another task, such as tidying a room. That person should be able to complete that task without being interrupted by the music I'm playing. If some notes ring out incorrectly and turn that person's attention back to me, I'm clearly doing something wrong. Writing is pretty similar. If I'm lost in a book, I'm lost in the music. Exceptional writing is writing that sings and forces me to listen. It takes me to a place I've never been, while at the same time conjuring a feeling that I've been there all along and never left. It's safe to say I will now be reading Provost's book _100 Ways to Improve Your Writing_. That quote alone has convinced me.
