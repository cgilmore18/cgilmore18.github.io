## First blog post on *First Draft Thoughts*!

Welcome to *First Draft Thoughts*! I've been thinking about making this blog for a while now---and what better time than the present? That's actually what this blog is all about: embracing the iterative nature of content. I'll be providing my first draft thoughts on topics including (but not limited to) technical writing, API documentation, content strategy, writing processes, efficient workflows, and AI.

## A Little About Me

I earned my bachelor's in computer science and professional writing at an engineering school, and I've been working as a technical writer at a software company for nearly two years. I'm passionate about working cross-functionally to support developers and staying up-to-date on industry trends to elevate the content I create. 

## What is *First Draft Thoughts*?

A previous (and incredible) manager of mine preached the importance of sharing *first draft thoughts*---being okay with sharing content early and often. While it's a simple practice to understand, sharing half-baked ideas can feel intimidating. Sometimes, you want to reach perfection on the first try, but that just isn't realistic or sustainable. Writing help documentation and similar content is, through and through, an ever-changing, iterative process---and one to be embraced. To keep things moving efficiently, we must accept that change is inevitable (especially in tech). It's best to keep up with changes, lean into them with confidence, and create solutions that lead to better experiences.

If you are passionate about content strategy or adopting writing processes that drive efficency and quality, this blog is for you.  

*First Draft Thoughts* isn't about being reactive, it's about starting *somewhere*, so you can get to where you want to be.

## Cadence

I plan on sharing long-form content biweekly (at the very least). I may also put out more content, potentially short-form content detailing my first draft thoughts on recent learnings. We'll navigate it together and see what sticks. Trust the process! :)
