# About

Welcome! I’m Carley, and this is not just a blog. This is a space for rambling. An outlet for sharing learnings from content design, 

Through this blog, I explore ideas about effective communication, storytelling, and the little joys of writing—like the charm of a typewriter or the fun of a first draft.
