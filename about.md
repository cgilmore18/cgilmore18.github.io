# About

Welcome to _First Draft Thoughts_! This is not your average writing blog. This is a space where terrible writing is encouraged. Wait what? You read that correctly. There's plenty of room for mistakes here.

_First Draft Thoughts_ is all about putting pen to paper no matter what, even if the ink is leaking all over the place. Because good content starts somewhere. Are you an aspiring writer suffering from perfectionist syndrome that causes you to judge every word you write, hell, every thought that flashes in your mind? Cool, me too! Oh, hi! I'm Carley. Come along with me as I embrace my First Draft Thoughts (nice little title drop, right?)! If you're itching to read honest posts about effective communication, storytelling, and the little joys of writing, you're in the right place.

Check out my [first post](https://firstdraftthoughts.com/2025/05/16/my-first-blog-post.html) to learn more.
